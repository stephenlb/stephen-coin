## 51% Attack Vulnerability Protection Approach

 - 51% attack vulnerability

> So the idea is a weighted decentralised network. We assign trusted users e.g. users with a lot of activity, market share and longevity a trusted value T. This value is maxed so we donâ€™t just have a monopoly and decays without continued honest work. These weighted accounts have higher priority when validating hashes. Each node signs its own state hash and includes hashes from other trusted nodes forming a web of interdependent signatures. Any manipulation would require simultaneous alteration across multiple trusted histories making attacks exponentially harder. Together these weighted cross-referenced checkpoints create a resilient self-regulating and transparent consensus where influence is earned through consistent proven reliability rather than sheer computational power.    
> I think this will nearly fully protect against 51% once the chain started. For the beginning a root node would still be best
